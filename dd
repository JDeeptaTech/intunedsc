Dear Team,

Today, we will be working on updating the CR (Change Request) creation process to ensure that newly identified CRs are appropriately filtered and do not overlap with any previously open CRs.

Additionally, we will proceed with implementing the CR closure process. Please ensure that all necessary steps are followed for a smooth transition.

Let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification.

Best regards,
