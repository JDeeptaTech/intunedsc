Thank you for joining today's call. Below is a summary of the discussion and the next steps. Please feel free to add anything I may have missed.

Key Points & Next Steps:
Ansible Logs & Task Timeout Issue: The issue persists, and other teams are also experiencing similar challenges.
Task Creation & Tracking: Michaelâ€™s team will create a task and share it with this group to facilitate tracking and resolution.
Investigation & ETA: Michael will collaborate with the team to investigate the issue further. As of now, there is no ETA for resolving this limitation in SAFE.
Alternative Solutions: In the meantime, Wipro will explore alternative approaches or solutions to ensure project delivery timelines are met.
Please let me know if there are any additional points to include. Your continued support and collaboration are greatly appreciated.
